# PCHex
3DS Homebrew Pokemon save editor

Right now just proof of concept

You need the latest git version of ctrulib, found here :
https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib

this will NOT work with devkitPro's base ctrulib

To install :
Copy PCHex.3dsx, PCHex.sdmh, PCHex.xml and the data folder in a folder named PCHex in your homebrew folder
